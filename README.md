# QuadTree
An implementation of a QuadTree with an HTML UI.

Open index.html to play around with the app.

Clicking inside the box would create points until enough points are in a quadrant. When the capacity is reached (Defaulted to 3), the app would create another quadrant.

The Quad tree also can create a boundary box which would return a list of all points inside it. To get all points inside boundary box, call the function insertBoundaryBox in quadTree.
